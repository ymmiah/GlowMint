**GlowMint** is an AI-powered photo editing application that uses the Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`) to magically transform your images based on text prompts. From simple enhancements to complex compositions, GlowMint provides a powerful yet intuitive interface for creative photo manipulation.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Prompt-Based Editing**: Describe any edit in natural language, from "add a cat wearing a party hat" to "make this look like a vintage photograph from the 1970s."
- **Multi-Image Composition**: Upload multiple photos and instruct the AI on how to combine them into collages, blends, or composites.
- **One-Click Quick Actions**: Access a library of professionally crafted prompts for common tasks like background removal, colorization, photo restoration, and applying artistic styles.
- **ü™Ñ Magic Erase**: A dedicated inpainting tool that allows you to simply paint over and remove any unwanted objects from your photos.
- **Advanced Controls**: Fine-tune your results with negative prompts to exclude unwanted elements and select from multiple output resolutions (Low, Medium, High).
- **Interactive Comparison**: Use the before-and-after slider to instantly see the impact of your edits.
- **Iterative Workflow**: Use any generated image as the new input for further edits, allowing you to layer effects and refine your creation.
- **Full History**: Never lose your progress with unlimited undo/redo capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: [React](https://react.dev/) 19, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **AI Model**: Google Gemini `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`
- **Gemini SDK**: [`@google/genai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google/genai)

## üìñ How to Use

GlowMint is designed to be intuitive. Follow these simple steps to start creating.

### Step 1: Upload Photos

- Click the upload area or drag and drop one or more images (PNG, JPG, WEBP).
- **Single Image**: Best for enhancements, style changes, or object removal.
- **Multiple Images**: Use a text prompt to describe how the AI should combine them.

### Step 2: Choose Your Edit

You have two powerful options for editing your photos:

1.  **Edit with a Prompt**:
    -   Write a detailed description of your desired edit in the main text box. The more specific your prompt, the better the result.
    -   **Example**: Instead of "make it look old," try "Give this photo a vintage look, like a faded polaroid from the 1980s with warm tones and light leaks."
    -   Click the "Try an example ‚ú®" button for inspiration.

2.  **Use Quick Actions**:
    -   For common edits, simply upload a single image and click one of the pre-defined actions like `Enhance`, `Remove BG`, `Colorize`, or `Cartoonify`.
    -   These actions use carefully crafted prompts to deliver consistent, high-quality results instantly.

### Step 3: Generate & Refine

-   Click the **‚ú® Generate Edit** button to send your request to the AI.
-   Your edited image will appear in the result panel. From there, you can:
    -   **Download** the final image.
    -   **Use as Input** to perform more edits on the new image.
    -   **Compare** the result with the original using an interactive slider.
    -   **Undo/Redo** your edits to experiment freely.

## üí° Pro Tips

-   **Negative Prompts**: Under "Advanced Options," describe what you *don't* want to see. This is great for removing text, watermarks, or avoiding common AI artifacts like "extra limbs."
-   **Resolution**: Choose your output quality. `High` provides the best detail but takes longer, while `Low` is faster for quick previews and iteration.
-   **Iterate!**: The "Use as Input" button is your key to complex creations. Start with a background removal, then use the result to add a new background, and then apply a color grade.

## üìú Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this section.

### [1.4.1] - 2025-10-11

#### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Download Functionality**: Fixed a bug where the download button would open the image in a new tab instead of saving the file. The download logic now directly converts the image data to a Blob to ensure consistent download behavior across all browsers.

### [1.4.0] - 2025-10-10

#### ‚ú® New Features
- **Enhanced Image Uploader**: Added robust drag-and-drop functionality to upload multiple images simultaneously. The uploader now displays individual progress for each file and shows clear error states for failed uploads, such as exceeding the file size limit.

### [1.3.0] - 2025-10-09

#### üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Refactoring
- **Centralized Theming System**: Refactored the entire UI theming system into a dedicated `/theme` directory. All theme variables and logic are now centralized in TypeScript, removing hardcoded styles from `index.html`. This makes adding or modifying themes significantly easier and more maintainable.
- **Dynamic Style Injection**: The application now dynamically generates and injects the theme stylesheet, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.

### [1.2.1] - 2025-10-03

#### ‚ú® New Features
- **Artistic Remix**: Added the "Style Remix" tool, allowing users to apply the complete artistic style of one image to another. The feature includes a dedicated modal for uploading a style image and an **optional prompt** to give the AI specific instructions, like 'only apply the color palette' or 'focus on the brush stroke texture'.
- **Sticker-fy**: Introduced the "Sticker-fy" quick action, which automatically isolates the main subject of a photo, adds a a white outline and drop shadow, and provides a final image with a transparent background.

### [1.2.0] - 2025-09-29

#### ‚ú® UI Overhaul & Batch Processing
- **Unified Display Area**: Replaced the previous side-by-side layout with a single, large, focused display area for viewing original and edited images, creating a cleaner and more immersive experience.
- **New View Modes**: Introduced flexible ways to compare images within the unified viewer:
    - **Toggle View**: A simple "Original" / "Edited" toggle to quickly switch between the two versions.
    - **Slider View**: An interactive slider for precise, pixel-level comparison.
    - **Side-by-Side View**: A classic two-panel view for a direct look at both images.
- **Streamlined Controls**: Organized all result-related actions (Download, Use as Input, View Mode selection) into a single, intuitive control bar below the display area.
- **Batch Processing Mode**: Added a powerful 'Batch' mode to apply the same edit to multiple images at once, complete with a progress bar and easy navigation through the results carousel.

### [1.1.1] - 2025-09-18

#### ‚ú® Feature Refinement: Paper Photo Fix

-   **Prompt Engineering**: Overhauled the "Paper Fix" quick action with a highly detailed, multi-stage "Digital Restoration Specialist" prompt.
-   **Improved Accuracy**: The new prompt forces the AI to follow a strict 4-stage process (Analysis, Plan, Execution, Verification) to ensure consistent, high-quality results.
-   **Advanced Flaw Removal**: Explicitly targets and removes common issues like glare, reflections, and motion blur.
-   **Smarter Object Removal**: Implemented non-negotiable logic for the AI to remove a person *and* the fingers covering them, preventing leftover artifacts.
-   **"Perfect Scan" Goal**: The entire process is now geared towards producing a result that is indistinguishable from a high-resolution flatbed scan.

### [1.1.0] - 2025-09-10

#### ‚ú® Feature Update: Power Tools

-   **New Features**:
    -   **"Magic Replace" Tool**: Added a new modal for selecting an area and replacing it with AI-generated content based on a text prompt.
    -   **"AI Background" Tool**: Implemented a feature to automatically isolate the subject and replace the background with an AI-generated scene. Includes AI-powered suggestions.
    -   **"Filters" Tool**: Introduced a gallery of artistic filters with live AI-generated previews.
    -   **"Crop & Rotate" Tool**: Added a comprehensive cropping and rotation tool with aspect ratio locks, freeform rotation, and an AI-powered auto-straighten feature.
